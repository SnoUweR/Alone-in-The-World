Alone-in-The-World
==================

Small game about a boy who was left alone in the world.

Unfortunately, the development of this game has become too hard for me, so I decided to freeze the project.

Used technologies: C#, XNA Framework, ScreenManager (class for XNA) and other stuff that I forgot.
